# Final project proposal

## Ryan's Calculator Proposal
I plan to create an FPGA hardware design that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division on 16-bit floating point numbers. The calculator will communicate with the rest of the
hardware in the same way as LED patterns, through some registers

## Noah's Proposal
Describe the other hardware and software proposal. The hardware and software must work together. Include a brief description of the hardware/software interface (e.g., what sort of registers will you create/use, etc.)

## Extra credit
Ryan:
	- Additional functions/operations on FPGA design
	- 
Noah:
	- 
	- 

## Division of labor
Briefly describe who will be working on what. For extra credit tasks and any software above the driver level, it is okay for both group members to work on a single piece, so long as the division of labor and responsibilities are clear.
